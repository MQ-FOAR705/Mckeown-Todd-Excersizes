The other file in this folder contains a set of intructions to be followed in order to implement my pipeline. 
This is the entirety of my project, it doesn't contain code as i felt it was important to create something that would actually be useful to my research. 
All i need is a way to bibliographies better, i don't need quanative analysis or statistical plotting or anything like that. 
I have used an open source program, Zotero to do just that. My pipeline shows how to install it, use it and a double sure method of disaster management. 
I know i've struggled in this course, i'm sure that this will not be great either but i honestly believe that this help my research.
