Final Implementation 

Step 1: Turn on computer 

Step 2: Open web browser (preferable Google Chrome)

Step 3: Search Zotero in your search engine of choice 

Step 4: Go to the Zotero Website

Step 5: Download Zotero (making sure to get the correct version for your computer)

Step 6: Download the Zotero web extension (built for chrome which is why it is a preferable choice of browser)

Step 7: Install Zotero 

Step 8: Run Zotero 

Step 9: Go back to the Zotero website and sign up for an account (this will involve using an email address to verify your account but is very straightforward.)

Step 10: In Zotero go to the edit menu, click on preferences then click on Sync, input your account details (this will enable you to share data across devices) 

Step 11: While still in the preferences menu go to the cite tab and select the format you wish to cite in (I picked Chicago 17th Full-Note) and make your you uncheck the include URL box unless you desire full URLs with every citation. 

Step 12: Search for desired source 

Step 13: Using the extension button near the top right of the screen (on the extensions bar) save your source to the Zotero library 

Step 14: Create a new collection to store these sources in Zotero by using the new collection button near the top left of the program screen

Step 15: Open word processor of your choice (Microsoft Word is preferable) 

Step 16: Create a space for your bibliography 

Step 17: Right click on your collection folder and click create Bibliography from collection 

Step 18: In word select the new Zotero tab, then click add citation. This will bring up a search bar that will allow to search through and select the desired source from the library. Then it added a citation along with a corresponding footnote for Chicago    

Step 19: In the Word document click Save As then select OneDrive (This is why word is preferable, not sure of other cloud-based storage systems)

Step 20: Place USB or external data-drive in USB slot

Step 21: Again, click Save As in the Word document then select the USB or data-drive and save a copy there as well.  

Step 22: (Optional) If you are working collaboratively you could also save a copy of your work to GitHub. This would allow for version control and independent networked work. Not required by my research but potentially useful to others.
