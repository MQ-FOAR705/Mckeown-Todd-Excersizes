1: Research Area
There exists a great wealth of data surrounding Viking/Norse grave sites, they have been
exhumed and examined for hundreds of years. However, in recent times we have come to
challenge the assumption the occupants of these graves are all male. Although the efforts
have been small scale thus far examination of several sites has revealed through bone and
DNA analysis that several of the occupants were in fact female. This has provoked much
debate and controversy in the historical community and the wider public. In order to
ascertain whether the discovered female graves were aberrations or indicative of lack of our
understanding of Norse culture practices a new re-examination of the catalogued grave sites
must be undertaken.

2: Problems
• There exist many catalogues of grave contents from various sites and time period,
too many to effectively individually check.
• Due to the relative newness of the concept and the controversy it may be difficult to
locate many sources
• Some of the sources may not be available in English
Goal: I need a simple and effective way to show the number of sites that exists and those
that have been re-examined. This could be achieved through the use of a number of
innovative spread-sheet type programs. Or perhaps Excel may be all I need; it bears further
investigation. I also hope to attain a working knowledge of a translation program more
advanced and accurate than Google Translate.
3: Pains and Gains
As previously identified, I often struggle with time management/procrastination issues and
all the problems that can cause with research. However, I feel that simply filling a
spreadsheet rather than creating an essay can help me manage this issue. The project is
straightforward and simple in scope and there forward it is unlikely that I will be able to get
off track. Plus, because it seems more manageable I’m more likely to be able to tackle it
without it feeling like the start of some massive project.

4: Decomposition
• Locate relevant research papers
• Examine other recent findings (If those papers are in English, a sub-step of
translation will be needed to be added otherwise)
• Note location and age of the sites
• Identify the several Viking/Norse grave sites that have been previous examined
• Identify those that have already been re-examined
• Tabulate these two in to separate spreadsheets
• Try and determine categories into which the tables can be divided further
• Use this data to seek commonalities (such as age of the sites, location and specific
culture)
• Use both these tables to propose a re-examination of certain sites based on
commonalities.
5: Algorithmic Design
• Research and retrieve relevant data
• Create two spreadsheets for the two categories of data
• Format the data into categories that make sense
• Use the data to determine the viability of commonalties
• If it is viable us this idea to propose my research concept
