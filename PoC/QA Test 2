After considerable investigation I determined that it is possible to edit the ways in which sources are linked to word processors from Zotero. But more importantly I discovered that there was a missing module that allows you to create footnotes with accompanying citations while work directly from Zotero. I will include that in this test run and adjust the steps accordingly. 

Step 1: Turn on computer 
Complete
Step 2: Open web browser (preferable Google Chrome)
Complete
Step 3: Search Zotero in your search engine of choice 
Complete
Step 4: Go to the Zotero Website
Complete
Step 5: Download Zotero (making sure to get the correct version for your computer)
Complete
Step 6: Download the Zotero web extension (built for chrome which is why it is a preferable choice of browser)
Complete
Step 7: Install Zotero 
Complete
Step 8: Run Zotero 
Complete
Step 9: Go back to the Zotero website and sign up for an account (this will involve using an email address to verify you account but is very straightforward.)
Complete
Step 10: In Zotero go to the edit menu, click on preferences then click on Sync, input your account details (this will enable you to share data across devices) 
Complete
Step 11: While still in the preferences menu go to the cite tab and select the format you wish to cite in (I picked Chicago 17th Full-Note) and make your you uncheck the include URL box unless you desire full URLs with every citation. 
Complete
Step 12: Search for desired source 
Complete
Step 13: Using the extension button near the top right of the screen (on the extensions bar) save your source to the Zotero library 
Complete 
Step 14: Create a new collection to store these sources in Zotero by using the new collection button near the top left of the program screen
Complete 
Step 15: Open word processor of your choice (Microsoft Word is preferable) 
Complete
Step 16: Create a space for your bibliography 
Complete 
Step 17: Right click on your collection folder and click create Bibliography from collection 
Complete 
Step 18: In word select the new Zotero tab, then click add citation. This will bring up a search bar that will allow to search through and select the desired source from the library. Then it added a citation along with a corresponding footnote for Chicago    
Complete 
Step 19: In the Word document click Save As then select OneDrive (This is why word is preferable, not sure of other cloud-based storage systems)
Complete
Step 20: Place USB or external data-drive in USB slot
Complete
Step 21: Again, click Save As in the Word document then select the USB or data-drive and save a copy there as well.  
Complete

Conclusion
This run worked a lot smoother than the previous run, I discovered additional functionality of the Zotero program that allow me to both automate and easy my work. Hopefully this will fulfil that requirement of the assignment. Hopefully this will not require too much more work to smooth out.
