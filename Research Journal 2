Data carpentry exercise 1 
Examining the spread sheet (messy) it is easy to identify many obvious issues. Several words are misspelled.
Data disappears into cells making it unreadable.
The layout is illogical making it almost impossible to retrieve relevant data.
Use of multiple tabs confuses computer systems. 
Use of parentheses also confuses computers and should be avoided. 
Single use of color to highlight data makes little sense to a human marker and none to a computer.
Inconsistent use of designators and identifying numbers make it impossible to discern the data.
It is organized in a highly illogical and inconsistent manner.
Placement of tables also insane.
Putting descriptions in cells.
Using special characters in cells.
Steps to be undertaken to rectify the issues:
Open a new Excel spreadsheet and separate the data for Mozambique only.
Create new column for “inc_barn” and removed the highlighted cell.
Moved “plots” and “livestock” to separate but adjacent columns to the dwelling graph.
Added four new separate columns for cows, goats, oxen and poultry.
Create new columns for “water_use” and “water_use_summer_only”
Issues: 
The Vague nature of the data present problems in comprehending the meaning of the values. 
Some data is contradictory 
Results: The proposed changes seem to extract what useful data can be obtained from the spreadsheet.
